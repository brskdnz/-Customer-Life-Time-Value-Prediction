# Calculating Customer Lifetime Value or CLV is considered a really important thing in marketing and ecommerce, yet most companies can’t do it properly. 
# This clever metric tells you the predicted value each customer will bring to your business over their lifetime, 
# and as such requires the ability to detect which customers will churn as well as what they’re likely to spend if they’re retained.
# Along with the RFM model, CLV is one of the most widely used models in marketing science today.
# Both are extremely useful for customer segmentation and a range of other ecommerce data science projects.
# CLV can be used to help you focus your attention on retaining the most important customers (and acquiring others like them),
# and it can help you forecast what you’ll get from your customers if you can retain them. 
# It’s also really useful for demonstrating the bigger picture to non-marketers who may think only of the operational costs of resolving issues,
#instead of the cost of losing a valuable customer.
